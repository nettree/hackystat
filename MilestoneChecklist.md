This page summarizes useful practices when preparing to deliver a milestone release of a Hackystat service for review.

## Project Milestone Release Checklist ##

  * Review the comments made from the last Milestone review, and make sure that they have been addressed in some fashion (for each comment, either make the fix, or decide that the comment is not valid, or else create an Issue for it.).
  * Post binary distribution {project}-{version}.zip to Downloads page.
  * Review and update UsersGuide, DevelopersGuide, and ReleaseNotes pages.
  * Make your distribution, UsersGuide, DevelopersGuide, and ReleaseNotes "Featured".
  * Update your Issues page.  Reassign any Issues scheduled but not achieved for this Milestone to a future Milestone.

## Milestone Review Announcement Checklist ##

  * Send a new posting to the hackystat-dev mailing list  with your review announcement. (Do not reply to an existing post, since that messes up the discussion threading.)
  * Provide link to your binary distribution for review.
  * Provide an explicit set of instructions on how people should interact with your system during review.
  * Provide an explicit set of questions that you would like the reviewers to address in their review.
  * Attempt to send out this email by 1:00pm on the day of the Milestone, but no later than midnight.
  * Here's an [example review announcement](http://groups.google.com/group/hackystat-dev/browse_thread/thread/78bd8afa703ad150).

## Milestone Meeting Preparation ##

The Milestone Meeting is typically at 1:00pm on the day following the Milestone.

  * Before the Milestone Meeting, spend no more than one hour reviewing each of the systems made available for review.
  * Write up and circulate your comments as replies to the review announcement posted to hackystat-dev.
