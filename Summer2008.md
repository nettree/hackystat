Hackystat has four students participating in the [2008 Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/).  As part of their responsibilities, the students will be keeping a blog and updating it once a week to summarize their progress, current issues, future plans, and anything else of interest.  This page provides links to these student projects, their associated blogs, and the day of the week when they will provide a weekly status report entry.  The [project proposals](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/hackystat/about.html) provide information about the goals of the projects.

Randy is not actually a GSoC participant, but he's doing a summer project so he'll come along for the ride. :)
