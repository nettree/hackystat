Since 2001, Hackystat has been used by a variety of research and industrial organizations to better understand software development.  Here are some examples of Hackystat use by the software development community.

| **Organization**  | **Collaborators** | **Description** |
|:------------------|:------------------|:----------------|
| [Google, Inc](http://www.google.com/) | Leslie Hawthorne | In 2007 and 2008, Hackystat was selected for the [Google Summer of Code](http://socghop.appspot.com/).  This meant that we were able to sponsor seven students who built a variety of interesting projects using Hackystat. |
| [Expedia, Inc](http://www.expedia.com/) | Faheem Khan, Dave Bakshani | Performed a case study of the use of Hackystat to support the internal engineering processes at Expedia, Inc.  As part of this effort, a new persistent back-end for Hackystat based upon Microsoft SQL server was implemented.  Other customizations to Hackystat were made to support the large number of projects and large software systems under development at Expedia.  Ideas from this collaboration were helpful in the development of the Software ICU, which was evaluated in a classroom setting and the results published in [We need more coverage, stat! Classroom experiences with the Software ICU](http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/09-02/09-02.pdf), Philip M. Johnson and Shaoxuan Zhang, Proceedings of the 2009 International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, Orlando Florida, October, 2009. |
| [University of Maryland,  Experimental Software Engineering Group](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/SoftEng/ESEG/) | Victor Basili, Marvin Zelkowitz | Performed a variety of experiments on programmer productivity as part of the [HPCS Development Time Working Group](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/SoftEng/ESEG/hpcs/).  Used Hackystat to record developer activities within editors and at the command line, and integrated Hackystat into their UMDInst toolset.  Example publication: [Combining Self-reported and Automatic Data to Improve Programming Effort Measurement](http://hpcs.cs.umd.edu/fileadmin/papers/fse-esec05.pdf), Lorin Hochstein, Victor R. Basili, Marvin V. Zelkowitz, Jeffrey K. Hollingsworth, Jeffrey Carver, Foundations of Software Engineering, 2005. |
| [Sun Microsystems, HPCS Productity Team](http://www.sun.com/) | Larry Votta, Michael Van De Vanter, Susan Squires | Performed research to understand productivity issues in high performance computing systems as part of the DARPA HPCS program.  Investigated integration of qualitative data collected manually through programmer diaries with quantitative data collected automatically by Hackystat. Example publication: [Software Productivity Research in High Performance Computing](http://www.ctwatch.org/quarterly/articles/2006/11/software-productivity-research-in-high-performance-computing/), Susan Squires, Michael Van De Vanter, Lawrence Votta, CTWatch Quarterly, November, 2006. |
| [SINTEF](http://www.sintef.no), Information and Communication Technology Division | Geir Hanssen | Performed a pilot case study on the use of the Zorro system to support technology transfer and adoption of Test Driven Design practices. (No publication available yet.) |
| [University of Nebraska, Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.unl.edu/) | Lorin Hochstein | Using data captured by Hackystat to visualize and identify programmer activities. Project page: [ActivityGraph](http://cse.unl.edu:8080/projects/ActivityGraph) |
| [6th Sense Analytics](http://www.6thsenseanalytics.com/) | Todd Olson, Greg Burnell | Used Hackystat as a technology basis for a commercial offering involving sensor-based acquisition of software developer behaviors.  White Paper: [6th Sense Metrics Overview](http://www.6thsenseanalytics.com/wp-content/assets/pdfs/6thSenseMetrics.pdf). |
| [NRC Institute for Information Technology, Software Engineering Group](http://iit-iti.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/about-sujet/seg-ggl_e.html) | Hakan Erdogmus | Performed research on inference rules for automated detection of Test Driven Design practices. Presentation slides using Hackystat visualizations of TDD: [An Overview of Test-Driven Development](http://softlab.boun.edu.tr/files/seminars/tdd.pdf), October, 2007. |
| [Politecnico di Torino, Software Engineering Group](http://softeng.polito.it/) | Maurizio Morisio | Used Hackystat to instrument a classroom setting in order to provide quantative data on testing behavior and its relationship to software quality. Example publication: [Assessing quantitatively a programming course](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1357918), M. Morisio, M. Torchiano, G. Argentieri, 10th International Symposium on Software Metrics, 2004.  |
| [University of Kaiserslautern, Software Engineering Processes and Measurement Group](http://wwwagse.informatik.uni-kl.de) | Dieter Rombach, Marcus Ciolkowski, Christoph Lofi | Performed research on the use of Hackystat to create a "continuous" approach to the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm in which the satisfaction of the GQM network can be evaluated in real-time, and trends in the level of satisfaction can be measured over time. Example publication: [Continuous GQM: An automated framework for the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm](http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/05-09/05-09.pdf), Christoph Lofi, Department of Software Engineering, Fachbereich Informatik, Universitat Kaiserslautern, Germany, M.S. Thesis, Number CSDL-05-09, August, 2005 |
| [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Mission Data System Project](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm) | Kenny Meyer | Used Hackystat to instrument and analyze the build system process and outcomes for the Mission Data System project.  Example publication: [The Hackystat-JPL configuration: Overview and Initial Results](http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/03-07/03-07.html), Philip M. Johnson, Department of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, Number CSDL-03-07, October, 2003. |
| [University of Hawaii, Collaborative Software Development Laboratory](http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu) | Philip Johnson | Integrated Hackystat into the software engineering curriculum to provide empirical guidance in adoption and improvement of software development techniques.  Example publication: [Practical automated process and product metric collection and analysis in a classroom setting: Lessons learned from Hackystat-UH](http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/03-12/03-12.pdf), Philip M. Johnson and Hongbing Kou and Joy M. Agustin and Qin Zhang and Aaron Kagawa and Takuya Yamashita, Proceedings of the 2004 International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering, Los Angeles, California, August, 2004. |
