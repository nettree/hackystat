### Public Release October 3, 2008 (8.1.1002) ###

The Hackystat development group is pleased to announce the public release of Hackystat 8.1.

Hackystat 8.0 was released in January, and we have made significant progress since then for Version 8.1:

  * The user interface has been re-implemented.

  * Multi-project telemetry is now available.

  * An entirely new analysis technique called Software Project Portfolio Analysis is available.

  * The Hackystat SensorBase service has been implemented with three different database back-ends: Apache Derby (the default), MS SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

  * The documentation is revised and improved.

Please see the project home page for links to download the system and to various tutorials:

http://www.hackystat.org/

We have several research projects underway at present:

  * A classroom-based evaluation of Software Project Portfolio Analysis.

  * A new analysis technique called "Trajectory Analysis", which allows comparison of project telemetries across time and automated detection of "similar trajectories".

  * A new analysis technique for distributed awareness called "Boswell", which will use social media such as Twitter or IM to improve understanding of development status and developer activities.

I would like to also mention that Hackystat was selected to participate in this year's Google Summer of Code, and we had three successful student projects.

As always, we look forward to your comments and welcome your participation.

### Public Release January 15, 2008 (8.0.115) ###

After approximately nine months of effort, it is with great pleasure that I announce the
public release of Hackystat 8.0.  This release is a ground-up rewrite of the framework to
support a RESTful service-oriented architecture along with many other significant
improvements.  Version 8 is significantly more scalable and enterprise-ready than Version
7. For example, we have measured throughput rates of over 1.2M sensor data instances per
hour.  We also find it to be both simpler and more fun to use than its predecessor.

We invite you to peruse the four tutorials linked to the home page, or any of the other
links that you find of interest.   Binary distributions of this release are available
there as "Featured Downloads", and of course the full source is available in the
Subversion repositories associated with the various projects. See the "Component
Directory" link for a full listing.

We hope that you will consider Hackystat for your future research, development, and/or
teaching.

Finally, I want to publicly and very gratefully acknowledge the following people who
contributed to the development of this first public release of Hackystat 8:  Austen Ito,
Cam Moore, David Nickles, Dan Port, Hongbing Kou, Julie Sakuda, Aaron Kagawa, Qin Zhang,
Robert Brewer, and Pavel Senin.
